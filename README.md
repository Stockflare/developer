# Full Stack Developer

Whether you have 5 months or 15 years of experience, Stockflare is looking to employ on a full-time basis, a "full-stack" developer that is competent with various languages, Docker, AWS, No/SQL Database technologies and familiar with the [twelve-factor application methodology](http://12factor.net/).

We are a remote-working company and every developer is responsible for managing and achieving their own objectives in a timely fashion; co-ordinating with the rest of the team on a daily basis. If you are a skilled developer, this position will offer you an unparalleled amount of freedom and flexibility to work with, share and evolve your own personal skills. We passionately encourage the use and incorporation of new languages and bleeding-edge technologies into our platform as it evolves.

At Stockflare, every project is maintained and documented similar to how you would expect to find an open source project. As many of the developers that would work with you are based in different timezones, they may not always be available to be asked questions about their work; being able to document and justify your technical implementations clearly (in English) is of the utmost importance.

## Values / Ethos

  * _"No bullshit"_ approach to getting stuff done.
  * Naturally passionate about expanding their knowledge.
  * Comfortable working with unfamiliar technologies.
  * Speak up. Happy to take charge and try their leadership skills.
  * Aren't afraid of (constantly) taking on new challenges & projects.

Whilst very rewarding, this position will challenge your competence and skills as a developer. If you're ready to take on the challenges of platform development, big-data, the problems of real-time analysis and speed, we encourage you to review the technical test section below and submit an application.

## Application Process

Follow the three steps below, be certain to read each step carefully.

### 1. Prepare your Resume/CV/Online Profile

Tell us who you are, we need some formal documentation or a link to your experience and history in the industry.

### 2. Technical Test

A skilled developer can learn and understand any language (given a little time). At Stockflare, we encourage the diversification of our stack and we reflect this in our technical test.

Having completed and reviewed numerous technical tests, where most are looked at with prejudice (and even disregarded), we wanted a different take on our technical test: _"How can we prove we're good enough for you, whilst you prove you're good enough for us?"_.

So, our test lets you test our developer(s) whilst we get to test you. Our testing process is simple, using one of the specifications found in this repository, compose a technical test as you would expect to receive one from us, using your preferred language. We will then complete it.

Time limits are pretty ridiculous. Spend as much time completing this test as you have value for the position your applying to.

### 3. Contribute

Writing as a developer myself, I am almost certain you have an idea for your own technical test specification. Using the other specifications as a format, write your own specification. You can be as creative as you like.

**Note:** This is separate to your technical test. We do not want you to submit your test based on your own specification, it has to be from one of our specifications.

### 4. Email it.

  0. Drop `date +%s` into a terminal, to get the current seconds since epoch.
  0. Attach your own Specification and Resume/CV and grab the link to your technical test on Github.
  0. Using the timestamp, send an email to `careers+developer+full-stack+<epoch_timestamp>@stockflare.com`.
