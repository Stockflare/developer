# Maze Generation

The Recursive Backtracking Search algorithm, is a (slightly inefficient) way of generating depth-first undirected graphs, which can also be used to randomly create (fun) mazes.

### For You: The Test

> Create an API that implements a backtracking search algorithm. The API will take as part of the request, a width and height value as well as a starting co-ordinate (catesian). A "maze" will then be generated and stored along with an idea inside a Database. The HTTP response will be an array of arrays, containing the generated maze as well as its associated ID.

### For Us: The Problem

> The responses are now being used as part of a game. Users are able to best each other's times for completing a maze. Implement an API Endpoint that enables the storing and retrieval of scores by users for particular Mazes.

## Things to Remember

* You can use _any_ language and technology that you think appropriate to efficiently solve this problem. We recommend using a development tool similar to [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) if you wish to incorporate the use of installation-required software.

* You are composing a technical test for us to complete for you. Document and instruct us in a way you would expect to receive and complete a technical test.

* Your technical test should be available to us through Github or Bitbucket, as a public or private repository.

* You should include as much documentation as necessary for our developer(s) to be able to painlessly run your solution (assume a UNIX machine).

  **Note:** _Documentation is incredibly important at Stockflare. Being able to clearly describe your development process so that it may be easily reproduced is key._
