# Currency Exchange Rates

Within the `Assets` folder of this specification directory, there is a seed file that may be used to pre-populate the API with exchange rate information.

### For You: The Test

> Using the `rates.csv` file, create a Currency API, that is able to return the exchange rate between any two currencies. Ie. `GBP` to `EUR`.

>It is important to note that all rates listed within the file are based in US Dollars. Ie. `USD:USD = 1:1`

### For Us: The Problem

> Create a new API Endpoint using the `currencies.csv` file, that is able to return the associated name for a particular currency code. The technical test should require this functionality to be implemented and tested.

## Things to Remember

* You can use _any_ language and technology that you think appropriate to efficiently solve this problem. We recommend using a development tool similar to [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) if you wish to incorporate the use of installation-required software.

* You are composing a technical test for us to complete for you. Document and instruct us in a way you would expect to receive and complete a technical test.

* Your technical test should be available to us through Github or Bitbucket, as a public or private repository.

* You should include as much documentation as necessary for our developer(s) to be able to painlessly run your solution (assume a UNIX machine).

  **Note:** _Documentation is incredibly important at Stockflare. Being able to clearly describe your development process so that it may be easily reproduced is key._
